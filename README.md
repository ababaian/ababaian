### RNA-based Lifeform

My passion is in the study of the interface between RNA and Genetics. Life's most fundamental gene, ribosomal RNA, is the catalyst for protein synthesis. I am defining the functional genetic (and epigenetic) sequence variation in human ribosomal RNA, and it's impact in human disease.
